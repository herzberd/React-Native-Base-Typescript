  "title": "New Spider-Man Trailer Reveals New York City Sites",
  "body": "A new Spider-Man gameplay trailer is debuting exclusively on IGN, and it centers on the open-world New York City that Spider-Man calls home.\n\nThe trailer, called Just the Facts: Marvel's New York, consists of Spider-Man swinging, spinning, and swan-diving through the upcoming game's open-world while a radio show hosted by J. Jonah Jameson plays in the background. In it, Jameson smack-talks everyone's favorite web-slinger while Peter Parker calls on the show to defend his alter ego.\n\nSome major landmarks are shown off in the trailer, both fictional and real. The video gives us a closer look at the Sanctum Sanctorum, the famous residence of Doctor Strange, and the Avengers Tower, headquarters of, you guessed it: The Avengers. As far as real-world landmarks, the Radio City Music Hall and a riff on MoMA called the Manhattan Museum of Contemporary Art (MMoCA) are both shown off.\n\nThe trailer also displays a lot of the game's open-world content beyond traversal, including finding Peter Parker's old backpacks scattered across the city, tracking down Oscorp research stations, and eliminating gang hideouts.\n\nInsomniac has also been going all-out in their advertising in New York City itself, reportedly putting a full-car subway advertisement on the Times Square Shuttle. Twitter user @JamesStevenson shared some pictures of the car online.\n\nColin Stevens is a freelance writer for IGN. Follow him on Twitter.",
